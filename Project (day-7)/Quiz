1)It returns a new array containing all the elements of the original array that satisfy the condition specified in the callback function.

2)The reduce() method reduces an array to a single value (number, string, object, etc.) by applying a callback function on each element.
It accumulates results as it iterates.

 3)slice()

Does not modify the original array.
Syntax: array.slice(start, end) → end index is not included.
Use case: copying or extracting part of an array.

ii)splice()

Modifies the original array.
Syntax: array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, …)
Use case: inserting, deleting, or replacing elements in an array.

4)What is the spread operator used for? (...)
The spread operator (...) expands arrays or objects.

5)A method is just a function stored as a property.
Example 
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello, I am " + this.name);
  }
};

// shorthand (ES6)
const person2 = {
  name: "Sara",
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}`);
  }
};

person.greet();  // Hello, I am John
person2.greet(); // Hello, I am Sara
